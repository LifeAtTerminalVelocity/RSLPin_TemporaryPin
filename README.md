# RSLPin TemporaryPin
This project is a Parachute Reserve packing temporary pin, being made out of an RSL Pin


The idea for this project started at the Parachute Industry Association (PIA) Symposium of 2025 held in Daytona Beach, Florida, USA.

A common problem that parachute riggers have is that the temporary pins that they employ to close the reserve pack tray are:
1) Expensive (relative to their expected lifetime).
2) Soft, easy to deform.
3) Deformations turn into nicks or gouges on the pin that damage the reserve closing loop.
4) Have to be replaced frequently.

The idea is to take a straight RSL Pin (Currently being made by CWH in Italy and sold world wide through their regional subsidiaries), encase said pin in a 3d printed plastic form to lend it rigidity and structure, and then having that encased in Type 3 webbing as a means to handle it and track it.

This repository will host the STL files needed to print the pin retention and rigidity plastic. This will also serve as to document the process of edits to this project. Keep in mind that in order to have greater strength and rigidity I have printed these using ASA and 100% infill. I have tried making versions that use lesser infill and they tend to fail after some time in the center stud that carries the load of the pin eye.
