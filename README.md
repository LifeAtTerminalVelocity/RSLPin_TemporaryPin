# RSLPin TemporaryPin
This project is a Parachute Reserve packing temporary pin, being made out of an RSL Pin


The idea for this project started at the Parachute Industry Association (PIA) Symposium of 2025 held in Daytona Beach, Florida, USA.

A common problem that parachute riggers have is that the temporary pins that they employ to close the reserve pack tray are:
1) Expensive (relative to their expected lifetime).
2) Soft, easy to deform.
3) Deformations turn into nicks or gouges on the pin that damage the reserve closing loop.
4) Have to be replaced frequently.

The idea is to take a straight RSL Pin (Currently being made by CWH in Italy and sold world wide through their regional subsidiaries), encase said pin in a 3d printed plastic form to lend it rigidity and structure, and then having that encased in Type 3 webbing as a means to handle it and track it.

This repository will host the STL files needed to print the pin retention and rigidity plastic. This will also serve as to document the process of edits to this project. Keep in mind that in order to have greater strength and rigidity I have printed these using ASA and 100% infill. I have tried making versions that use lesser infill and they tend to fail after some time in the center stud that carries the load of the pin eye.

The latest STL files:
  
  v7.x - <a href="https://github.com/LifeAtTerminalVelocity/RSLPin_TemporaryPin/blob/main/STL/RSL%20Pin%20Holder%20-%20v7.5%20Long.stl">Latest 7.x STL</a>
  
  v9.x - <a href="https://github.com/LifeAtTerminalVelocity/RSLPin_TemporaryPin/blob/main/STL/RSL%20Pin%20Holder%20-%20v9.6%20Long.stl)">Latest 9.x STL</a>

The latest 3MF files:
  
  v7.x - <a href="https://github.com/LifeAtTerminalVelocity/RSLPin_TemporaryPin/blob/main/3MF/RSL%20Pin%20Holder%20-%20v7.5%20Long.3mf">Latest 7.x 3MF</a>
  
  v9.x - <a href="https://github.com/LifeAtTerminalVelocity/RSLPin_TemporaryPin/blob/main/3MF/RSL%20Pin%20Holder%20-%20v9.6%20Long.3mf">Latest 9.x 3MF</a>

Versions 1-5:

These are poorly revision managed initial itterations to fit the pin into the plastic holder. This version is meant to be used with 1" (2.54cm) Type 4 webbing.

Version 6:

This is the first iteration of the pin holder that fits well. The initial 3 prototypes were made with this version. This version is meant to be used with 1" (2.54cm) Type 4 webbing.

Version 6.1:
Similar to version 6 but this version is meant to be used with 1.5" (3.81cm) Type 4 webbing.

Version 6.2:
A revision of v 6.1 incorporating feedback from the riggers that tested v6 and v6.1. It features cut off corners.

Version 6.3
A revision of v 6.2 incorporating feedback from the riggers that tested v6.2. It features thru holes for tacking down the pin.

Version 7.x:
A revision of v6.2 with a longer length (3" or 7.6cm) to allow for better handling of the pin. Going forward this version will be the "Long" version of the RSL Pin Holder. Revisions within it will be documented under this block.

Version 8.x:
Attemps to make the RSL Pin Holder a clamshell design. This fails misserably. I might try this again in the future with a different approach to the clamshell but right now the focus will be v7.x and v9.x

<img src="https://github.com/LifeAtTerminalVelocity/RSLPin_TemporaryPin/blob/main/img/v8_2.jpeg" alt="">

Version 9.x:
Together with v7.x this will be the standard length (1" or 2.54cm) version of the RSL Pin Holder. Going forward this version will be the "Long" version of the RSL Pin Holder. Revisions within it will be documented under this block.
