# Build Instructions for v9.x

You can follow these instructions to build yourself a version 9.x Temporary pin.

1) Cut 30" (76cm) of your favorite colored Type 3 or Type 4 webbing.

2) Fold back 6" (15cm).

3) Use the printed holder as a guide and mark your webbing for: Width, length, and exit point of the RSL Pin. I like to mark my webbing with 1/16th" (1.5mm) gap on either side.

4) Run a straight stitch line from the fold over edge to the length of the RSL Pin Holder.

5) Run a second straight stitch line from the fold over edge to the length of the RSP Pin Holder on the opposite side. This will make the tunnel where the RSL Pin Holder will be inserted into.

6) Your webbing should look something like this now:

7) Seat the RSL Pin into the RSL Pin Holder. This will be a *snug* fit.

8) (Optional)Using some Supertack line secure the pin to the RSL Pin Holder. There are 3 holes around the perimeter, and one on the center. I line up my tack so that I can slip the knot into the center hole within the pin retention mechanism. Use all 3 perimeter holes to form a retention line against the pin.

9) Insert the RSL Pin & RSL Pin Holder into the tunnel made in the webbing. Keep in mind that this will also be a snug fit and that you will have to scrunch the material so that you can line up the RSL Pin Tip with the mark you made for where it should exit on the webbing.

10) Your assembly should look like this now.

11) Run a stitch line behind the end of the RSL Pin holder as close as you can get with the foot of the sewing machine down.

12) Run another stitch as close as you can get to the RSL Pin Holder with the sewing machine foot up.

13) Fold over the remaining webbing from the 1st fold over back under itself so that it butts up to the stitch line.

14) Run a zigzag stitch along the length of fold over edge. The idea here is to remove any snag points on your temp pin lanyard. The ones I build have a zigzag stitch going and another one coming.

15) Your completed pin should look like this.
